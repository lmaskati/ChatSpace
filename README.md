#Assignment 4

##Design
I chose lilac, grey and white as my theme colors. My chatroom has a simple interface, which is easy to navigate. When a user hovers over a button, a shadow appears below it.

##Additional realtime features
Live typing notifications

##Extra Credit
Emoji usage: I used the node modules 'retext' and 'retext-emoji', to allow users to have emojis in their messages. The module converts emoji symbols such as :) or <3 to emojis and displays them in the posts.

Censoring: I used the node module 'profanity-censor', to censor abusive language. This module replaces any abusive word in a message with a string of asterisks, with an * for each letter in the word.

(Real time) When a user enters, leaves or changes their username, all the other users are notified
